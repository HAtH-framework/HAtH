# HAtH
## Be at home, be safe, use HAtH


We all live in a nighmare. A virus had come haunt our lives. In some cases it has killed people around us or it made people badly ill. 

This virus is not a joke and we have to avoid it. COVID19 can create a lot of damages to both us and our societies. 

These damages are: medical, economics and psycological. In effect a lot of people had seen their capacity to interact socially badly reduced. A lot of people (elder, recovering ones, etc) are experiencing social problems as addendum to the sanitary and economics problems that all we see around us. 

How HAtH can helps? HAth will summarize and integrate data coming from different sources in 'a traffic light' hints given to the people. So people can contact medical autorithies or friends/relatives, or simply go to park to walk! 

## some stories: 

Alice is recovering from the ill: she is ok and, get permission to exit from home. But she has some remaing problems... She want to avoid useless risks. HAtH will show some 'traffic light' hints based on both meteo, satellite pollution data, local weather sensors. The light is green so Alice go to park nearby and enjoy the sun! 

Bob is feeling bad, and the physician told him 'wait and see'. But to avoid surprise they give him some sensors to connect to HAtH. HAtH will read the values and show hints based on traffic ligth code. Bad luck! the ligth is yellow, tomorrow Bob will ask to the hospital for new checks and exams. 

Eve has some health problems (respiratory). She want to see her nephews so, she ask for HAtH hints. HAtH show red ligth! Bad luck? No HAtH give her some hints how to make a video conference whith both her nephews. The family integrity is safe!
