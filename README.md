# HAtH
## Be at home, be safe, use HAtH

We are all living in a nigthmare. A virus has come haunt our lives. In some cases it has killed people around us, in other cases it has made people badly ill also raising depression issues.

This virus is not a joke and we have to manage the situation. COVID19 can create a lot of damages both to us and our societies.

These damages are: medical, psycological and economical. A lot of people has drastically experienced a reduced capacity of social interaction. A lot of people (mostly the elderly, the sick ones, etc.) are still experiencing social problems as addendum to the sanitary and economics problems that all we see around us, producing a feeling of loneliness without any support from outside.

How HAtH can help? HAth will summarize and integrate data coming from different sources in 'a traffic light' hints given to the people. So people can contact medical autorithies or friends/relatives, or simply go to park to walk!

some example of HAtH implementations:
Alice has just recovered from her illness, she is ok and get permission to exit from home. But she has still some residual problem... She wants to avoid useless risks. HAtH will show some 'traffic light' hints based on both meteo, satellite pollution data, local weather sensors. The light is green so Alice go to park nearby and enjoy the sun!

Bob is feeling bad, and the physician told him 'wait and see'. But to avoid surprise they give him some sensors to connect to HAtH. HAtH will read the values and show hints based on traffic ligth code. Bad luck! the ligth is yellow, tomorrow Bob will ask to the hospital for new checks and exams.

Eve has some health issues (respiratory). She wants to see her nephews, so she asks for HAtH hints. HAtH shows red ligth! Bad luck? No, HAtH give her some hints how to make a video conference whith both her nephews. The family integrity is safe!

Granny receive a visit at the door. She doesn't know who is that person, so a relative can connect by HAtH and answer the door. Then, if is a legit visit it's all right, if is a scam everything will be reported or the person at the door will flee.

And thousands more possible implementation of HAtH!
